  /// must discover the services offered by the peripheral to understand how to communicate with it effectively.
  /// Each service can have multiple characteristics, which are like "channels" of communication.
  /// By understanding these services and characteristics, our Flutter app can read from or write to
  /// these channels to facilitate meaningful exchanges of data.
  ///
  /// The purpose of this method is to convert the raw service and characteristic data received from the method channel
  /// into a structured format (a list of [BleService] objects) for Dart, and then pass them through the provided stream controller.

  /// ## BLE Communication Overview
  ///
  /// In the BLE protocol, devices communicate by reading and writing to 'characteristics' exposed by each other's
  /// services. Characteristics are essentially data variables that a peripheral device exposes to other devices.
  /// When writing data to a characteristic, the information is generally treated as a list of hexadecimal numbers,
  /// mapping to bytes at a relatively low level in the Bluetooth communication stack.
  ///
  /// ## Encrypted Write Operations
  ///
  /// If the target characteristic has encrypted write permissions, the Android operating system should automatically
  /// prompt the user to complete a pairing request with the BLE device. Pairing is a prerequisite to encrypted
  /// communication and enhances the security of the data exchange.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [characteristic]: The BLE characteristic to which the data will be written. This should include both the device
  ///   address and the UUID of the characteristic.
  /// - [value]: The data to be written to the characteristic, generally a string that will be converted into
  ///   bytes/hexadecimals.
  /// - [writeType]: Optional parameter to specify the type of write operation. Defaults to
  ///   `BluetoothGattCharacteristic.WRITE_TYPE_DEFAULT`. Different write types have different transmission and
  ///   confirmation behaviors.

  /// This safeguards against situations where the asynchronous operation hangs indefinitely.
  ///
  /// Note: A [TimeoutException] does not necessarily indicate a failure in reading the characteristic, but rather
  /// that a response was not received in the given timeframe. Ensure that the timeout value is appropriate for the
  /// expected device response times and consider retrying the operation if necessary.
  ///
  /// - `address`: The MAC address of the Bluetooth device. This uniquely identifies
  ///   the device and is used to fetch the associated BluetoothGatt instance.
  /// - `characteristicUuid`: The UUID of the characteristic whose value is to be read.
  ///   This UUID should match one of the characteristics available on the connected
  ///   Bluetooth device.
  /// - `timeout`: The maximum amount of time this function will wait for a response from
  ///   the platform side. If this duration is exceeded without receiving a response,
  ///   a [TimeoutException] will be thrown. Ensure that this duration accounts for
  ///   potential delays in device communication.
